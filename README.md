# Fuzz Cola (Silver DSP)

Fuzz Cola is a guitar fuzz/distortion plugin (VST3 + AU).

## Install on Windows (VST3)

1) Quit your DAW.

2) Copy **Fuzz Cola.vst3** to your VST3 folder:

- **System-wide (recommended):**
  - `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`

(If you use a custom VST3 folder, put it there instead.)

3) Re-scan plugins in your DAW (or restart the DAW).


## Install on macOS (VST3)

1) Quit your DAW (Logic, Ableton, Reaper, etc).

2) Copy the plugin to the system VST3 folder:

- **System-wide (recommended):**
  - `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/`

If the folder doesn’t exist, create it.

3) Rescan plugins in your DAW, or restart the DAW.

### If macOS says “is damaged and can’t be opened”
This is usually Gatekeeper/quarantine on downloaded build artifacts.

If this occur use an app other than Archive to open the .zip file, like Keka
